#fuctions are a collection of reusable code that can be called when needed
#functions are used to perform a specific task
#functions are defined using the def keyword
#functions can take parameters and return values
#functions are used for organizing code into smaller, manageable pieces
#functions are used to avoid code duplication and make the code more readable
#functions can be called multiple times with different arguments
#functions can be called from other functions
#functions can be called from the main program
#functions can be called from the command line
#functions can be called from other modules
#functions can be called from other packages
#functions can be called from other libraries
#functions can be called from other scripts
