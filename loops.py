#loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times
#there are two types of primary loops in python:
#for loop and while loop
#for loop is used when the number of iterations is known
#for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string or range)
#syntax:
#for variable in sequence:
    # statements

# fruits = ["a","b","c","d","e"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# text = "Python"
# for char in text:
#     print(char)
